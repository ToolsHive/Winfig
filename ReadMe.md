## Features
- **Modular Scripts**: Easily customize and extend your setup with modular scripts.
- **Essential Tools**: Focuses on essential tools and configurations for developers.
- **Opinionated Defaults**: Comes with sensible defaults to enhance productivity.
- **Cross-Platform**: While primarily for Windows, it can be adapted for other platforms with minor tweaks.
- **Custom Dotfiles** : Supports custom dotfiles for personalized configurations.
- **Automated Setup**: Automates the installation and configuration of tools and settings.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or later
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Internet connection for downloading packages
- Administrator privileges for certain installations

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Configuration Wizard** - Complete the guided setup process
2. **System Integration** - Restart system to initialize all components
3. **Operational Validation** - Execute diagnostic verification procedures

> **Administrative Requirements**: Elevated PowerShell privileges required for proper installation.

## Safety & Troubleshooting

- Backup important config files before running. Testing in a VM is recommended.
- If you encounter repeated elevation prompts when using the iwr|iex one-liner, manually run the downloaded script from an elevated PowerShell window.
- If you get parser/encoding errors after download, ensure the file is saved in UTF-8 and hasn't been edited in a way that breaks quoted strings or backtick line continuations.
- If package manager installs fail, install the package manager (winget/choco) manually and re-run the script.

##  Contributing

Professional contributions are welcomed from the development community.

### Development Workflow

1. **Repository Fork** - Create independent development branch
2. **Feature Development** - Implement changes in isolated branch (`git checkout -b feature/enhancement`)
3. **Code Commitment** - Document changes with descriptive commit messages
4. **Branch Publication** - Push feature branch to forked repository
5. **Pull Request Submission** - Submit formal code review request

### Contribution Standards

- **Issue Reporting** - Utilize standardized issue templates for consistency
- **Enhancement Proposals** - Engage in architectural discussions prior to implementation
- **Documentation** - Maintain comprehensive documentation standards
- **Quality Assurance** - Implement comprehensive testing for new functionality
